I can neatly divide my programming career into pre-Code Complete, pre-Clean Code and after. I recommend this book after reading Code Complete, because while Code Complete deals more with the structure of individual lines of code and methods, Clean Code deals with some of the same concepts, but at a slightly higher level.</p>\n<p>It's pretty difficult to read this book and not become a better programmer.</p>","excerpt":"Quite often I am asked about the top programming books that I'd recommend all software developers should read.
